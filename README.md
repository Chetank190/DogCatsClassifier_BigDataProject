# DogCatsClassifier_BigDataProject
Our project revolves about using deep learning techniques to classify the images of Cats and Dogs. Our classification system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which takes an image as input, assigns weights and biases to each aspect of the image, and then uses that information to classify the image. On a very high level, for each image, the prediction is compared with its existing label, and the error between the prediction and the truth is computed. By modifying the parameters of the network, the error is minimized via backpropagation, thus increasing the prediction ability of the network.  The main objective here is to teach the model the various distinguishing features of cats and dogs. Upon completion of the training of the model, it will be able to differentiate between images of cats and dogs. We have used the Keras library for training the classifier.   We are also exploring the state-of-the-art CNN models to examine the challenges involved in assembling a series of CNN layers to perform a specific function using a data pipeline. The individual layers each perform distinct tasks, so in order to develop a real-world CNN application, it is often necessary to experiment before finding the ideal layer combination.
